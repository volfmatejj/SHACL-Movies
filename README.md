# SHACL Movie Validation Project

This repository contains the technical artifacts for a semester project focused on
validating movie data from DBpedia using SHACL.

## Contents
- `shapes/` – SHACL shape graph for dbo:Film validation
- `data/` – RDF datasets (synthetic and real-world)
- `sparql/` – SPARQL CONSTRUCT query used to extract data from DBpedia
- `reports/` – Validation reports generated during testing

## Description
The project demonstrates how SHACL can be used to distinguish between
critical data quality issues (violations) and softer data completeness problems (warnings)
in open linked data.
